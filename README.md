# AUSWeather: Predicting Rainfall in Australian Cities 🌧️

This project was developed as part of the *Machine Learning with Python* course on Coursera. It applies supervised learning models to predict the likelihood of rain using historical Australian weather data.

## 📊 Project Summary
- Built classification models to predict `RainTomorrow`
- Explored features like temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

## 📁 Files Included
- `AUSWeather.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis and model training
- `weather.csv`: Cleaned dataset (or link to the source if data is not included)
- `model_output.png`: (Optional) Screenshot or graph results
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) Python packages used

## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Data cleaning and imputation (using pandas)
- Visualizations (matplotlib & seaborn)

## 📚 Dataset
- [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/)
- Dataset sourced via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
